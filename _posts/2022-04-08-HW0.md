In this post, I'll show how to create an interesting data visualization using the Palmer Penguins data set.

## Loading in the Data

Make sure you have the pandas library in your environment first. Then we can load in the data by doing this:

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

## Observations

Now lets look at our data and see what strikes us as interesting.

```python
penguins
```

Looking at this data set I would like to compare the Culmen Depths to the Culmen Lengths of each of the three penguin species- Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.
A good way to do this would be using scatterplots with Culmen Depths being the x-axis and Culmen Lengths being the y-axis. Since I'm doing this with all three
of the penguin species I would need to create three graphs for each species.

## Creating the Graphs

We can make the scatter plots by doing the following: 

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">
We'll need to have the matplotlib library in our environment in order to create this graph.
```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize = (15,5))
penguin_species = {"Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)" : (0, "Blue"), 'Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)' : (1, "Red"),
                   'Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)' : (2, "Green")}
def f(df):
    current = ax[penguin_species[df.iloc[2,2]][0]]
    current.scatter(df["Culmen Length (mm)"], df["Culmen Depth (mm)"], color = penguin_species[df.iloc[2,2]][1], 
    alpha = 0.7, linewidth = 0.5)
    current.set(title = df.iloc[2,2])
    ax[0].set(ylabel = "Culmen Length (mm)")
    ax[0].set(xlabel = "Culmen Depth (mm)")
    ax[1].set(xlabel = "Culmen Depth (mm)")
    ax[2].set(xlabel = "Culmen Depth (mm)")
penguins.groupby(["Species"]).apply(f)
```
This creates a nice 3 by 1 look for our graphs.

{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
