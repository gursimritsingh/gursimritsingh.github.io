In this post, I'll show how to create an interesting data visualization using the Palmer Penguins data set.

## Loading in the Data

Make sure you have the pandas library in your environment first. Then we can load in the data by doing this:

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
